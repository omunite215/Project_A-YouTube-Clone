Made using tutorial of [JavaScipt Mastery](https://youtu.be/FHTbsZEJspU?feature=shared).

ProVid is a YouTube clone developed by Om Patel and hosted on Netlify. One of the standout features of ProVid is its effective utilization of MaterialUI, which provides a visually appealing and intuitive interface for users to navigate. Additionally, the clone was built using ReactJS, a powerful JavaScript library for building user interfaces, which allows for greater flexibility and customization. Overall, ProVid is a great example of a well-designed and functional video sharing platform that has taken advantage of the latest web development technologies.

### The project is hosted on Vercel : [Provid](https://providbyom.netlify.app/)
